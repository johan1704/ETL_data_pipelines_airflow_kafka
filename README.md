You are a data engineer at a data analytics consulting company. You have been assigned to a project that aims to de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas. As a vehicle passes a toll plaza, the vehicle's data like vehicle_id,vehicle_type,toll_plaza_id and timestamp are streamed to Kafka. Your job is to create a data pipe line that collects the streaming data and loads it into a database.
